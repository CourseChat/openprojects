# Major new advance: new materials capture water from air at close to zero cost in energy and materials

## New passive capture yields water in < 20% humidity arid regions of the world

- Major change for arid regions: crops, herds, agricultural development
-  Exciting new capability for all home construction: generate water locally for each house from humidity in air; 
- Autonomous water source frees users from piped infrastructure
- Use PV to power small pumps used to extract water from the capture surfaces, so household systems can be autonomous.
- No PG&E, no EBMUD or Marin Water needed
- In humid climate, cycle home humidity for cooking, plant watering, showering
## Water costs:  $0.01 / liter
	- material cost for MOF material using aluminum is very low
	- design for deployment at household level is in early stages; new devices being designed by many companies
	- UC Berkeley test devices were deployed in Mojave desert; used PV for energy for pumps; demonstrated completely off-grid passive capture
	- Can scale to any volume desired
## Older technologies used energy to cool air to condense
	- Inefficient; costly; only useable with humidity greater than 40%
	- Many companies exist, but now should be replaced by new materials technology

## New technology to capture water condensation in arid regions developed at UC Berkeley
- MOF: Metallic Organic Frameworks
	- 1000X surface area of existing materials
	- new "framework" is like a crystalline framework, but with spaces tuned to attract and contain specific molecules: water, CO2
	- Examine BASF website for commercial offering; early adopter, manufacturing MOF in metric ton amounts
	- Find all commercia
	-  [[Omar Yaghi]] patents? IP?
## Same technology can capture $CO_{2}$
## Scientific leaders
