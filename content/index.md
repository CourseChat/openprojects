## Description
- This is an list of open projects, open in the sense that their purpose is defined, but their implementation is constantly evolving. All share one common goal: to support collaboration in design and implementation.  
- 
- Several of the links are to projects to [annotate lectures with accompanying Jupyter Notebooks](Build%20Jupyter%20notebook%20supplement%20to%20ELP%20Water%20lectures), allowing computations to occur in parallel with the lecture, and then be modified to create specific examples that might correspond more specifically to a student's interests.
