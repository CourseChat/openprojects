To determine the right size pump for your system, you'll need to calculate the total dynamic head (TDH) and use that information to select a pump that can efficiently deliver the required flow rate (25 gallons per minute) at the calculated TDH. Follow these steps:

Use friction calculation for 1 1/4 " pipe at 25 gpm: 11 feet per 100 ft



## Static head calculation

- Pump intake is on bottom of Lake Tahoe, at an elevation of 6330?, or 20 feet below surface
- June 2024 lake level is high

1. Calculate the total static head (TSH):
    - TSH is the vertical distance the water needs to be lifted. In your case, it's 40 feet.
2. Calculate the friction head loss (FHL):
    - FHL is the pressure loss due to friction in the pipes. It depends on the pipe size, material, and flow rate.
    - Use a friction loss chart or calculator specific to your pipe size and material.
    - For example, if you have a 1.5-inch PVC pipe and a flow rate of 25 GPM, the friction loss might be around 4 feet per 100 feet of pipe.
    - In this case, pump to tank is 200 feet.
    - Tank to service point on 3rd floor of 1590 Sequoia is:
	    - 134.5
	    - 240
	    - 320/2 = 160
	    - total: 534.5
    - Multiply the friction loss by the total pipe length (in hundreds of feet) to get the total friction head loss.
3. Calculate the velocity head (VH):
    - VH is the energy required to accelerate the water to the fluid velocity in the pipe.
    - For most residential and small commercial applications, the velocity head is negligible compared to the static head and friction head loss.
## Dynamic head

1. Calculate the total dynamic head (TDH):
    - TDH = TSH + FHL + VH
    - In your case, if we assume a friction head loss of 4 feet per 100 feet and a pipe length of 200 feet, the TDH would be: TDH = 60 feet + (4 feet/100 feet × 200 feet) + 0 = 68 feet
2. Select a pump based on the flow rate and TDH:
    - Consult pump performance curves from manufacturers to find a pump that can deliver 25 GPM at a head of 68 feet (or the calculated TDH).
    - Look for a pump with a performance curve that shows an operating point close to your required flow rate and TDH.
    - Consider factors such as pump efficiency, power consumption, and material compatibility when making your selection.
3. Calculate the pump power:
    - The pump power can be estimated using the formula: Power (HP) = (GPM × TDH) / (3960 × Pump Efficiency)
    - Assume a pump efficiency of 60% (0.6) for this example.
    - Power (HP) = (25 GPM × 68 feet) / (3960 × 0.6) = 0.71 HP
    - Choose a pump with a power rating higher than the calculated value to account for system losses and ensure adequate performance.

In this example, you would need a pump that can deliver at least 25 GPM at a head of 68 feet, with a power rating of 3/4 HP or higher.
