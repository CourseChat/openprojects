# A national program to allow neighbors to develop and share facts about their neighborhood.  
- As we build a common understanding of how we share water, electricity, waste and sewage facilities, flood protection, earthquake and storm preparation, and the ecology and environment in which we make our homes, we can develop a common agenda to protect and improve our neighborhood

## Examples
### Neighborhood
- Berkeley Elmwood district
- Oakland Fruitvale district: Berkeley ecoblock
