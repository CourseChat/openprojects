# Lecture series for a general public
- This note explores how to build an attractive and continuing program of access to the wealth of Berkeley lectures and courses in a theatrical, large-screen presentation space such as Rialto's Elmwood and El Cerrito theaters.
- We propose trials of several packages of combinations of lectures and personal presentations. We seek to answer a simple question: **can we fill a theater during the day with interested attendees: students, auditors, and general public?** 

---
-  October, 2024: Here is a work-in-progress to build a menu of  available lectures, courses, and other Berkeley materials suitable for presentation in theatrical venues. As a first pass, here are links to **candidate lecture series**. 
- Secondly, **candidate graduate and undergraduate courses**: from the two to three thousand courses offered each semester, a second page is building a list of recommended courses.  Here is a [preliminary example focused on environmental courses](Classes-Fall-2024)
-  Each heading below is for a different lecture or public presentation series now programmed on the Berkeley campus, and potentially available for screening in other locations.
- Separately, each semester there are massive class offerings--thousands of students are enrolled in Data Science 8, or Data Science 100--so live lectures, or time-shifted lectures may be available for screening in an off-campus setting. It's an open question if streamed courses would attract students and auditors to an off-campus auditorium.
- A new kind of lecture series is now possible, allowing general or overview lectures by prominent Berkeley scholars to be accompanied or followed by a complete series of their class lectures, drawing from several years of their classes.
- **Berkeley Events** is the overall campus events calendar for each day, listing public lectures of general interest, academic lectures in specific subject areas, and other campus events at the Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA), or in Zellerbach Auditorium. 
- Special semester-long sequences of lectures may draw from a wide range of Berkeley experts, as in the **Berkeley Brilliance** semester in Spring, 2024, to be repeated in Spring 2025. Nobel laureates, or those with particularly important research topics, present a general explanation of their work in a twenty to thirty-minute format. 
- The **Haas Dean's Speaker Series**, the **Berkeley Graduate Lectures**, **Basic Science Lights the Way**, **Science At Cal**, **Berkeley Lecture Series Engaging the Iranian Community** are all available to stream for a general audience
- **Academic Earth** streams a series of lectures, but currently only for those with access to the campus **CalNet** network, which is to say, only accessible to students, faculty and staff.  However, to access CalNet, there is a special category, **Sponsored Guest**, available to auditors and outside researchers, that can be awarded by any faculty or staff member, and thus has potential access to **Academic Earth**, and to any class, with instructor permission.
