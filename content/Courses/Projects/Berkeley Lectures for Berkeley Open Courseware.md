# Lecture series for a general public
### How can we build an attractive and continuing program of access to the wealth of Berkeley lectures and courses in a theatrical, large-screen presentation space such as Rialto's Elmwood and El Cerrito theaters?
- We propose trials of several packages of combinations of pubic lectures, class lectures, and in-person presentations. 
- We seek to answer a simple question: **can we fill a theater during the day with interested attendees: students, auditors, and general public?** 
- We could feature one Berkeley Nobel laureate, such as Jennifer Doudna.....show a 20-minute general overview of CRISPR by Doudna downstairs, and show her actual course upstairs--in 2025, stream the actual Biology 1 taught by Jennifer Doudna. 

| Elmwood <br> Theater                | Seating | Type of Presentation                         | Material                                                                            |

| Main Downstairs<br> Screen | 300     | Lecture                                      | Berkeley Brilliance: <br>Nobel lecturers                                             |
| Upstairs<br> A             | 60      | 2025 Class by Nobel laureate                 | [CRISPR](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-spring-biology-1a-001-lec-001) |
| Upstairs<br> B             | 60      | Foundations of Data Science<br>1100 students | [Data C8](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-spring-data-c8-001-lec-001)     |

Other candidates for a screen: 
- the OLLI lecture series: pick any of the popular courses of the past 5 years; 
- The more advanced Data Science course: 1000 students
- The Haas Dean's Speaker series, showing  a different lecture each day from a list of 50 recent lectures.
- Academic Earth, after the permission requirement is relaxed to include community members
- At the moment, some of the best lectures--30 minute overviews of the most exciting topics, as in the Berkeley Brilliance lectures--require campus credentials, called "CalNet" access, or "Sponsored Guest" access, to stream. We can give you that "Sponsored Guest" access instantly, while we work to get that requirement lifted for the 2024 and 2025 lectures.

-  **November, 2024**: This is a work-in-progress to build a menu of  available lectures, courses, and other Berkeley materials suitable for presentation in theatrical venues. As a first pass, here are links to **candidate lecture series**. 
- Secondly, **candidate graduate and undergraduate courses**: from the two to three thousand courses offered each semester, a second page is building a list of recommended courses.  Here is a [preliminary example focused on environmental courses](Classes-Fall-2024)
-  Each heading below is for a different lecture or public presentation series now programmed on the Berkeley campus, and potentially available for screening in other locations.
- Separately, each semester there are massive class offerings--thousands of students are enrolled in Data Science 8, or Data Science 100--so live lectures, or time-shifted lectures may be available for screening in an off-campus setting. It's an open question if streamed courses would attract students and auditors to an off-campus auditorium.
- A new kind of lecture series is now possible, allowing general or overview lectures by prominent Berkeley scholars to be accompanied or followed by a complete series of their class lectures, drawing from several years of their classes.
- **Berkeley Events** is the overall campus events calendar for each day, listing public lectures of general interest, academic lectures in specific subject areas, and other campus events at the Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA), or in Zellerbach Auditorium. 
- Special semester-long sequences of lectures may draw from a wide range of Berkeley experts, as in the **Berkeley Brilliance** semester in Spring, 2024, to be repeated in Spring 2025. Nobel laureates, or those with particularly important research topics, present a general explanation of their work in a twenty to thirty-minute format. 
- The **Haas Dean's Speaker Series**, the **Berkeley Graduate Lectures**, **Basic Science Lights the Way**, **Science At Cal**, **Berkeley Lecture Series Engaging the Iranian Community** are all available to stream for a general audience
- **Academic Earth** streams a series of lectures, but currently only for those with access to the campus **CalNet** network, which is to say, only accessible to students, faculty and staff.  However, to access CalNet, there is a special category, **Sponsored Guest**, available to auditors and outside researchers, that can be awarded by any faculty or staff member, and thus has potential access to **Academic Earth**, and to any class, with instructor permission.
