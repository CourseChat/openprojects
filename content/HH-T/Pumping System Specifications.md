## Service
- Water is supplied to three structures:
	- 1620 Sequoia main house: 3bd, 3 bath
		- when occupied: 120 gal/day
	- 1590 Sequoia main house:  6bd, 3 bath
		- occupied: 120 gal/day
	- 1590 1/2 Sequoia cottage: 1 bd, 1 bath
		- 100 gal/day
- Pipe run from pump house to each structure:
	- To 1620: 50 feet to house; unknown to irrigation
		- rise: 20 feet
	- To 1590 main house: 535 feet
		- rise: 40 feet
	- To 1590 1/2: 100 feet beyond main house
		- rise from main house interconnect: 20 feet
## Existing system
- Installed in 1950's to feed original house at 1590 Sequoia
- Unknown water systems served original house since its construction in 1916.
- Rebuilt when 1620 Sequoia was constructed in 1979
- Possible renovations after July, 1988, when Marston occupied and rebuilt 1590 Sequoia
- Pump controller replaced by Marston after 1990
### Estimates to replace existing system

[[Hoffman Plumbing]] has specified [[McDonald]] pumps

The current pump specification is 2HP, single phase, 3-wire. 

To determine the right size pump for this system, calculate the total dynamic head (TDH) and use that information to select a pump that can efficiently deliver the required flow rate (25 gallons per minute) at the calculated TDH. Follow these steps:

Use friction calculation for 1 1/4 " pipe at 25 gpm: 11 feet per 100 ft



## Static head calculation

- Pump intake is on bottom of Lake Tahoe, at an elevation of 6210'. (from surveyor maps)
- Lake Tahoe Low Water Level is 6223', and the high water line is 6229.1'. 
- The base of the pump house is at 6230', so the pipe rise from the bottom is 20 feet. 
- At today's high lake level, the pump is 20' below surface.
- June 2024 lake level is high, at 6228'
- From the intake into the storage tank in the pump house, the rise to the highest service point at 1590 Sequoia is 40'.  That is the shower on the second floor of the house.
- That elevation is higher than the highest service point in the third structure supplied: the cottage at 1590 1/2.

1. Calculate the total static head (TSH):
    - TSH is the vertical distance the water needs to be lifted. In this case, it's 40 feet.
2. Calculate the friction head loss (FHL):
    - FHL is the pressure loss due to friction in the pipes. It depends on the pipe size, material, and flow rate.
    - Use a friction loss chart or calculator specific to your pipe size and material.
	    - link to chart to come:
    - For example, for a 1.5-inch PVC pipe and a flow rate of 25 GPM, the friction loss might be around 4 feet per 100 feet of pipe.
    - In this case, pump to tank is 200 feet.
    - Tank to service point on 3rd floor of 1590 Sequoia is:
	    - 134.5
	    - 240
	    - 320/2 = 160
	    - total: 534.5
    - Multiply the friction loss by the total pipe length (in hundreds of feet) to get the total friction head loss.
3. Calculate the velocity head (VH):
    - VH is the energy required to accelerate the water to the fluid velocity in the pipe.
    - For most residential and small commercial applications, the velocity head is negligible compared to the static head and friction head loss.
## Dynamic head

1. Calculate the total dynamic head (TDH):
    - TDH = TSH + FHL + VH
    - In your case, if we assume a friction head loss of 4 feet per 100 feet and a pipe length of 200 feet, the TDH would be: TDH = 60 feet + (4 feet/100 feet × 200 feet) + 0 = 68 feet
2. Select a pump based on the flow rate and TDH:
    - Consult pump performance curves from manufacturers to find a pump that can deliver 25 GPM at a head of 68 feet (or the calculated TDH).
    - Look for a pump with a performance curve that shows an operating point close to your required flow rate and TDH.
    - Consider factors such as pump efficiency, power consumption, and material compatibility when making your selection.
3. Calculate the pump power:
    - The pump power can be estimated using the formula: Power (HP) = (GPM × TDH) / (3960 × Pump Efficiency)
    - Assume a pump efficiency of 60% (0.6) for this example.
    - Power (HP) = (25 GPM × 68 feet) / (3960 × 0.6) = 0.71 HP
    - Choose a pump with a power rating higher than the calculated value to account for system losses and ensure adequate performance.

In this example, you would need a pump that can deliver at least 25 GPM at a head of 68 feet, with a power rating of 3/4 HP or higher.
